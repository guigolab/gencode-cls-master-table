# Gencode-cls-master-table
Here we specifically report on the results of the GENCODE pipeline to produce a collection of full length high quality transcript. 

# Background
We employed CLS to target genomic regions with apparently weak, but potentially relevant, transcriptional activity. These include, among others, regions predicted to encode lncRNAs, enhancers, precursors of small RNAs, RNAs predicted to contain structural motifs, host non-coding GWAS hits or regions showing evolutionary characteristics of protein coding gene, or that are evolutionary conserved. Probes were designed in the human genome version hg38 using gencode v27 as reference annotation, and RNA has been captured in multiple matched adult and embryonic tissues in both human and mouse. All long RNAseq reads have been processed using [LyRic](https://github.com/guigolab/LyRic), employing short read RNAseq data to support long reads derived transcript models.
